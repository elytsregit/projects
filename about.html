	   <p>From an early age, Sammie King (pictured above) was obsessed with sports.  He would save up all his allowance from mowing lawns around the neighborhood just to buy small packs of trading cards in hopes of finding a "big score".  The first big item that Sammie discovered was a Kareem Abdul-Jabbar rookie card that he still has to this day.  It is the piece that started this obsession that eventually turned into a business.</p>
