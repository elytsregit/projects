			<h2>About Our Event</h2>
			<p class="indexPara">In the Summer of 1995, the city council of Mount Vista had extra money left over and spent weeks deliberating what they should invest it in for the community.  That is when a few members came up with the idea of having a holiday talent show every year in which the entire community comes together to share their talents and socialize.  From that moment on, the city of Mount Vista has held our annual talent show every year between Christmas and New Years Eve.  This year, we are excited to announce that we are holding our annual talent show on December 28th, 2019 at the Mount Vista High School Auditorium.  Every year we go out and look for sponsorships for our event to make sure it is always better than the last year.  However, this year, most of our sponsors came to us and personally asked to be part of this big event that means so much to the community.  Every year this event gets better and better and we believe that it is a direct reflection on the amazing nature of the citizens of Mount Vista!</p>
			<p>Each year we have so many performers that come to show off their extraordinary talents.  We have had musicians, acrobats, jugglers, comedians, gymnasts, athletes, and many more amazing acts.  You will find an audio clip below that is from one of our most popular acts that ended up recording one of their songs and making an album.</p>
			
			<audio class="purpleAudio" src="Purple Planet Music - Prohibition Blues 2813A5129.mp3" controls></audio>
			
			<p>This is just a small sample of the amazing types of talent you will find at our annual Talent Show!</p><br>
