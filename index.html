      <h1>Welcome to Sammie's Sports Memorabilia!</h1>

      <p><b>Hey folks, I am Sammie and welcome to my sports memorabilia shop!</b>
      </p>
	 

      <p>If you are looking for some of the hottest sports memorabilia and collectibles in the greater Culver Springs area, you have found the right place.  Here at Sammie's, we cater to all sports fans and have built our business around excellent service and going above and beyond finding specific items for our customers.  At this point in time, we have yet to create a shop for our website where customers can purchase their products and have them delivered.  However, we are excited to announce that this will be a feature we are adding to our website in the Fall of 2020.  Until that point, we suggest that you stop by in person or call us on the phone to inquire about any of our collectibles or to show us what collectibles you might want to sell to us.
      </p>

      <p>Take a few minutes to navigate around our website and see what we have to offer.  Feel free to head over to our contact page for any specific questions pertaining to our business, or take a minute to e-mail our webmaster if you have any issues with navigating the website.
      </p>

      <h3>Thanks, and we will see you when you stop by!
      </h3>
