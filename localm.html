      <h1>Local Sports Memorabilia for Sale</h1>
      <p>Here at Sammie's, there are two things we are extremely passionate about, sports and our community.  That is why we have recently started to collect and carry memorabilia from our local sports teams.  We have reached out to the athletic departments of Culver Springs High School and Culver Springs Sacred Heart to collect pieces of game-worn gear to sell at our Culver Springs location.  All of the proceeds from these sales will be sent back to the athletic departments of their respective schools so that the kids can get upgraded athletic equipment, have state-of-the-art workout equipment, and be ready to go beat up on some of our rivals!</p>
	   <p>Below, you will find some of the items we have for sale.  Feel free to contact us or stop by if you are interested in purchasing any of the items or sponsoring any of our local sports teams.</p>
